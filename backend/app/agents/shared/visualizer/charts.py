"""Which chart, drawn from which columns.

Split deliberately in two. The rules below decide what is *possible* — that is a question about
shapes, and shapes are something code judges more reliably than a language model: a pie chart of
eighty categories is wrong no matter how confidently it was chosen. The model then decides which
of the possible charts best answers the question that was asked, which is a question about
meaning, and one code has no purchase on at all.

Because it picks from a numbered list rather than naming columns freely, a hallucinated column
name isn't something that has to be caught after the fact — it can't be expressed.
