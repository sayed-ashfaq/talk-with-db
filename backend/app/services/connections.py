"""Persistence for saved connections and schema annotations.

Everything here talks to *our* metadata store. Actually reaching out to a user's target database —
connecting, introspecting, running SQL — lives in app.agents.sql_agent.db, which this module calls
into but never the other way around. The live engine for whoever is currently connected is held by
app.services.connection_registry.

Every function takes the signed-in user and filters on their id. A connection is private to the
account that created it; there is no path here that reads a row without checking ownership.
