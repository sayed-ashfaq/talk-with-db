# NL2SQL

Ask a database questions in plain English. Connect to Postgres or MySQL, ask a question, get a natural-language answer back.

## Status: Planning

We're designing this piece by piece — agree on a step, build it, test it, then move to the next. Nothing below is final until we've both signed off on it.

## Progress log

- [x] Main agent (supervisor) — routes each message to `sql_agent`, `knowledge_agent`, `python_agent`, or answers directly. Built as a LangGraph graph, exposed via `POST /chat`. Tested against all four routes.
- [x] `sql_agent`, `knowledge_agent`, `python_agent` exist as **buffer/stub nodes** — wired into the graph so routing is provable end-to-end, but they don't do real work yet.
- [x] Folder structure matches the agreed layout below (`core/`, one-folder-per-agent). Minimal logging (`app/core/logging.py`) and a base exception class (`app/core/exceptions.py`, `NL2SQLError`) are wired in — `main.py` has a handler for it, `chat.py` logs each request's message and route. More exceptions get added as each agent actually needs them, not ahead of time.
- [x] Logging reformatted to match the reference format (`asctime - name - levelname - processName - message`), writing to both console and a daily-rotating `logs/nl2sql.log` (30-day retention).
- [x] Main agent's real logic is built out — not just a router anymore:
  - `AgentState` (`agents/main_agent/state.py`) carries `chat_history` (clean user/assistant turns only), the current `question`, the LLM-refined `refined_query` handed to whichever specialist runs, `next` (routing decision), `agent_output` (the specialist's raw response), `attempts` (loop guard), and `final_answer`.
  - `supervisor_node` is one recurring node, called again after every specialist responds: it decides which specialist to use (or that no specialist is needed), refines the query for it (resolving pronouns/context via `chat_history`), and — once a specialist has answered — judges whether that answer actually resolves the question. If yes, it's returned as-is; if no, it re-routes (same or a different specialist) up to `MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3), then gives up gracefully with the last response.
  - `chat_history` persistence is **stateless**: the server doesn't keep sessions. `POST /chat` accepts an optional `history` array and returns the updated one; the caller resends it next turn. (Revisit a server-side session/checkpointer later if this gets unwieldy.)
  - Tested live: direct chit-chat, a DB-shaped question looping against the `sql_agent` stub, and a two-turn conversation where "how many rows does **it** have?" correctly resolved to the `orders` table mentioned in the prior turn.
- [x] `sql_agent` is real:
  - `agents/sql_agent/sql.py` cleans model output before anything touches the database: extract from fences → sanitize unicode → format via sqlparse → extract statement (rejects multi-statement output, doesn't just truncate to the first) → transpile via sqlglot for the target dialect (pretty-printed, not squashed to one line) → sanitize again → block destructive keywords (word-boundary match + a SELECT/WITH allow-list, not naive substring matching).
  - `agents/sql_agent/agents.py` is an internal subgraph: generate → execute → (on error) fix → execute, up to 3 fix attempts, then synthesize in a business-analyst tone (one-liner for a single value, table + a called-out insight otherwise) or give up gracefully.
  - Every step logs its own latency (`Routing decision`, `SQL generation`, `SQL execution`, `SQL fix attempt`, `Response synthesis`, `Total query completion`) plus the actual content at each stage (`Generated SQL query`, `Formatted Fixed SQL query`, `Extracted SQL query`, `Transformed SQL query SQLglot`, `Final answer`) — all multi-line/pretty, matching the reference log format.
  - `run_query` sets a 10s statement timeout (Postgres `statement_timeout` / MySQL `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`) before running anything.
  - **Tested live against a real production database** (read-only credentials) — a single-value question and a multi-CTE failure-rate-by-station question both succeeded on the first attempt, no fix-loop needed.
- [x] Saved, switchable DB connections — no longer just one in-memory connection:
  - Credentials persist in their own dedicated Postgres (a separate local `nl2sql_meta_db` container/database, not the target DB, not SQLite) via `app/agents/sql_agent/db.py`'s `saved_connections` table, encrypted at rest (`app/core/crypto.py`, Fernet — key from `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`). `METADATA_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points at this metadata store.
  - `app/router/connections.py`: `POST /connections` (save+test+activate — structured host/port/user/password/dbname **or** a raw `url`), `GET /connections` (list, no secrets returned), `POST /connections/{id}/activate` (switch), `DELETE /connections/{id}`.
  - Still single-active-connection at a time (not per-session) — this is a switchable toggle, not concurrent multi-tenancy.
  - Found and fixed two real bugs during testing: (1) SQLAlchemy's `str(url)` masks the password as `***` — needed `render_as_string(hide_password=False)` instead, or the raw-`url` path would silently connect with a literal `***` password; (2) saving a duplicate connection name 500'd with a raw `IntegrityError` traceback — now a clean error message.
- [x] Write-operation guardrails, two layers deep:
  - **Main agent (before generation):** the supervisor's routing prompt refuses to send write-intent questions ("delete...", "update...", "insert...") to `sql_agent` at all — routes to `respond` instead, which explains the read-only boundary directly. Tested live: "Delete all rows from the saved_connections table" correctly routed to `respond`, never touched `sql_agent`.
  - **sql_agent (after generation, before execution):** `enforce_read_only()` now raises a dedicated `DestructiveSQLError` (not the generic `UnsafeSQLError`) for a blocked keyword or a non-SELECT/WITH statement. `execute_node` catches it separately and skips the fix-retry loop entirely — retrying would mean asking the model to silently reinterpret a write request as a read one, which is the wrong behavior. It routes straight to `synthesize_node`, which is told the request was blocked and produces a natural-language refusal in the same voice as normal answers, rather than a hardcoded string. Verified directly (bypassing generation) with a `DELETE` and with a destructive statement smuggled inside a `WITH` CTE — both correctly blocked without touching the fix loop.
- [x] Schema introspection was doing an N+1 round trip per table (`get_columns`/`get_pk_constraint`/`get_foreign_keys` called separately for every table) — fine on localhost, ~70s over a real WAN link. Switched to SQLAlchemy 2.0's bulk reflection (`get_multi_columns` etc.) — flat ~6 queries regardless of table count instead of `~4-5 × N`. Verified against the same slow remote DB: ~70s → ~10s.
- [x] Fixed a Groq structured-output failure: the supervisor's `Decision.resolved` field was `bool`, and the model occasionally emitted `"resolved": "true"` (a JSON string) instead of a JSON boolean — Groq validates tool-call arguments server-side and rejects the whole request with a 400 before it reaches our code, so no amount of handling on our end could catch/coerce it after the fact. Changed the field to `Literal["yes", "no"]` (a string enum), which sidesteps the boolean-vs-string-boolean ambiguity entirely. Also added a catch-all `Exception` handler in `main.py` as a safety net for any future unhandled failure from an external API call — logs and returns a clean 500 instead of a bare traceback.
- [ ] `knowledge_agent` for real — Tavily + optional DB access. **Next up.**
- [x] Visualization, as a declarative chart spec rather than generated code:
  - `agents/visualizer/` profiles a result by shape (`profile.py`), derives every chart it can honestly support (`charts.py`), and asks a model only which of those best answers the question — picking by *index*, so a hallucinated column name isn't something to catch afterwards, it's something that can't be expressed. Nothing is executed: the spec crosses the API as JSON and React draws it, so there is no sandbox to escape.
  - Runs in parallel with response synthesis inside `sql_agent` (a list-returning conditional edge), so a chart costs no wall-clock time.
  - The row cap moved off the model: it no longer writes `LIMIT` to keep results small — `sql.apply_row_cap` enforces 5000 in the SQL text, the synthesizer sees the first 50, and the client gets all of them.
  - `python_agent` is gone. It was replaced by `visualizer`, which re-charts rows an earlier turn already fetched ("show that as a pie chart") instead of re-running the query — same rules, same model call, no second trip to the user's database.
  - Results are stored on the message (`messages.result_data`, JSONB, trimmed to a 256 KB budget by even-stride sampling), so a reopened conversation shows its charts rather than just its prose.
- [ ] **Experimental, not wired in:** `agents/sql_agent/schema_graph.py` — graph-based schema linking, as an alternative to dumping the full schema into every prompt. Tables → nodes, FKs → edges (`networkx`), built once per connection like the existing schema fetch. Per question: LLM extracts entities → local embeddings (`fastembed`, `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) match entities to anchor tables → graph traversal (shortest path / Steiner tree) connects the anchors, surfacing join-path tables the question never named → LLM renders just that narrow slice into a minimal schema block. Tested live against the 15-table prod schema: a question naming only "stations" and "vehicles" correctly pulled in `inspection_entity` as the connecting table purely from FK structure, with no textual hint of it in the question. Found and fixed two real bugs while building it: the context-builder was redundantly re-running graph traversal on its own output instead of using the already-computed edges, and the Steiner-tree path crashed on an unrelated disconnected table (`migrations`) elsewhere in the same schema — fixed by restricting traversal to the connected component containing the anchors. Not connected to `agents.py`'s actual generation flow, which still uses the full `schema_text` — this is a standalone prototype to evaluate before deciding whether to integrate it.

## The pipeline

```
User connects to Postgres or MySQL
        |
        v
User asks a question in natural language
        |
        v
Main Agent  -- reads the question, decides it needs the database, hands off to the SQL Agent
        |
        v
SQL Agent   -- gets the schema (fetched via python) + dialect-specific context (Postgres vs MySQL)
               + rules, all as a system prompt --> writes a SQL query
        |
        v
Clean + Execute -- python strips/validates the generated SQL, runs it against the DB, collects results
        |
        v
Synthesizer -- checks the results actually answer the original question, turns them into natural language
        |
        v
Main Agent  -- decides whether to hand that answer back as-is, then responds to the user
```

## Design principles

- **Build incrementally.** One component at a time, tested before moving on.
- **No OpenAI/Anthropic keys.** LLM calls go through Groq's API, with room for local models later.
- **Orchestration via LangGraph, LLM plumbing via LangChain.**
- **Dialect-aware.** Postgres and MySQL get different schema context and rules, not one generic prompt.

## Graph design (LangGraph state machine)

One shared state carries: `question`, `db_dialect`, `schema`, `generated_sql`, `execution_result` / `error`, `synthesized_answer`, `final_answer`.

```
Main Agent (router)  -- is this a DB question, or chit-chat/out-of-scope?
        | (DB question)
        v
SQL Agent  -- schema + dialect rules + question --> SQL
        |
        v
Clean + Execute (plain python)  -- strip fences, reject anything non-SELECT, run it
        |
        |<-- on error, loop back to SQL Agent with the error (max ~2 retries)
        v
Synthesizer  -- results + question --> checks it actually answers it, writes NL answer
        |
        v
Main Agent (final check)  -- guardrail: withhold/reframe if the answer doesn't hold up
        |
        v
Response to user
```

Key calls locked in so far:
- **Full schema first.** Dump the whole schema for the connected DB into the SQL Agent's context. Only add relevant-table retrieval later if a real schema is too large for context — don't build retrieval before we know we need it.
- **Read-only, twice.** Reject any non-SELECT statement in the Clean + Execute step, independent of whatever DB-level permissions the connection uses. Defense in depth, not either/or.

## Open questions (tracked as we go)

- Exact retry cap / backoff for the SQL self-correction loop
- How much schema to hand the SQL Agent as schemas grow (see "full schema first" above)
- Which specific Groq models per agent (see below — proposal, not locked)

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| LLM provider | Groq API only for now — local models come later, behind the same interface |
| Agent orchestration | LangGraph |
| LLM framework | LangChain |
| Database | Postgres, MySQL |
| API layer | FastAPI, from the start |
| Package manager | uv (based on current `pyproject.toml` setup) |

**Model per agent** (different models per node, not one everywhere) — locked in, set via env in `app/config.py`:
- Main Agent (routing + chit-chat) — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- SQL Agent (generation) — `openai/gpt-oss-120b`.
- Knowledge Agent, Python Agent, Synthesizer — not assigned yet, will pick when each is actually built.

## Multi-agent shape

The main agent is a **supervisor** over specialist sub-agents, not a single fixed SQL pipeline. It looks at the message and routes to exactly one of:

- `sql_agent` — NL2SQL against the connected Postgres/MySQL database. **Current build priority.**
- `knowledge_agent` — web search (Tavily) and/or the connected database for lookups that aren't a SQL query. Buffer for now.
- `visualizer` — re-draws an earlier turn's result as a different chart, from the rows already fetched. (Charts on fresh queries are produced inside `sql_agent`, alongside the answer.)
- direct response — greetings, meta questions, anything needing no specialist.

More specialists (e.g. a research agent) can be added later as additional routes without changing this shape. The "pipeline" diagram above describes what happens *inside* `sql_agent` once it's built for real — that's still the plan for that node specifically.

Notes:
- **One agent = one folder.** Each agent owns its own state — nothing about sql_agent's retry loop leaks into the shared top-level state, and vice versa.
- **`main_agent` is the connector.** `main_agent/main.py` is the one place that imports the other agents' node functions and wires the full graph together — the "main.py for agents." It also holds the router (LLM picks a route) and the direct-answer node (chit-chat, no specialist needed).
- **Single DB connection for now**, not multi-session — `sql_agent/db.py` holds simple state, not a per-user registry.
- **`db.py` vs `sql.py`:** `db.py` is the generic DB toolkit (connect, introspect schema, run a query, return rows). `sql.py` is the NL2SQL-specific orchestration around a generated query (clean it, safety-check it, call `db.py`, shape the result for the synthesizer). Avoids duplicating execution logic.

Frontend requirements (simple React + JS UI — chat, SQL toggle, charts) are tracked separately in `frontend/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
